Installation
============

Environment
===========
This project has been fully tested on **Kali Linux**, it should also work on other 
Debian-based systems.

You need to make sure you have **Python 3** installed to run *Jok3r*. 

The following tools must be installed to be able to run several security checks 
in *Jok3r* (installed by default on Kali Linux):

* Metasploit (msfconsole)
* Nmap

Install
=======
To install *Jok3r*, run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

	sudo python3 setup.py install

.. note::
	``setup.py`` will install several packages that are needed to make sure that 
	the tools inside the *Jok3r*'s toolbox can be run, such as: ruby, perl, nodejs...

The first thing to do is then to install all the tools in the toolbox by running:

.. code-block:: console

	sudo python3 jok3r.py toolbox --install-all --fast
